# Bootstrap 5

This is my personal package to create websites with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/).

## Initial setup

Run  ``npm install`` to install dependencies.

## Build

Run  ``npx mix`` to build a customized distribution. The build will be saved in the ``dist`` directory.
